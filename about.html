      <p> Hello! I’m Kazim Ali, a passionate and dedicated Software Engineering student. I’m driven by a strong desire to learn, build, and grow in the tech industry. I’ve already started shaping my journey through multiple internships, including one at CodeClause, where I built projects like a Blog Website.

 That’s why I enjoy diving deep into web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and continuously improving my skills. I also have a keen interest in self-development, and exploring the teachings of Imam Ali (a.s.) and Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s.) for spiritual and mental growth.</p></section>
